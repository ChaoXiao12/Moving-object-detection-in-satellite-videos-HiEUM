## Algorithm Introduction

Highly Efficient and Unsupervised Framework for Moving Object Detection in Satellite Videos, Chao Xiao, Wei An, Yifan Zhang, et. al. 

We propose a highly efficient unsupervised framework for moving object detection in satellite videos (SVMOD). Specifically, we propose a generic unsupervised framework for SVMOD, in which pseudo labels generated by a traditional method can evolve with the training process to promote detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a highly efficient and effective sparse convolutional anchor-free detection network by sampling the dense multi-frame image form into a sparse spatio-temporal point cloud representation and skipping the redundant computation on background regions. Coping these two designs, we can achieve both high efficiency (label and computation efficiency) and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can not only process 98.8 frames per second on 1024X1024 images but also achieve state-of-the-art performance.
